'''
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. 
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

'''

s = "azcbobobegghakl"
longest = s[0]
current = s[0]

# start from second letter s[1:]
for c in s[1:]:
    if c >= current[-1]:
        current += c
        if len(current) > len(longest):
            longest = current
    else:
        current = c
print("Longest substring in alphabetical order is:", longest)
